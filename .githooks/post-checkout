# Git Hook: post-checkout
# ==============================================================================
# Runs after checkout to enforce Git Flow branching model.
#
# Features:
# - ✅ Git Flow base branch validation (CRITICAL)
# - ✅ Prevents feature branches from main
# - ✅ Prevents hotfix branches from develop
# - ✅ Protected branch warnings
# - ✅ Branch naming convention validation
# - ✅ Context-aware error messages with fixes
#
# Git Flow Rules Enforced:
# - Feature/bugfix/support branches → MUST branch from 'develop'
# - Hotfix branches → MUST branch from 'main'
# - Release branches → MUST branch from 'develop'
#
# Environment Variables:
# - BYPASS_HOOKS=1: Skip hook (not recommended for base branch validation)
